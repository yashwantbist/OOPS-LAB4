# OOPS-LAB4
**Ship Class Implementation
**Overview**
This C++ program demonstrates the use of constructors, destructors, and dynamic memory management in a Ship class. The program creates Ship objects using both default and parameterized constructors, dynamically allocates memory for the objects, and then deallocates memory using destructors. The program simulates the creation and sinking of ships with messages displayed at the time of object creation and destruction.

Key Features:
Ship Class: The class represents a ship with a name attribute.
Default Constructor: Initializes a ship with the name "N/A".
Parameterized Constructor: Allows for the initialization of a ship with a specified name.
Destructor: Displays a message when a ship object is destroyed, simulating the sinking of the ship.
